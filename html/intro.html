        <b>With the development of the Internet, women as well as men can also learn to knit and crochet quickly and easily. If you browse through social networking sites, there are nearly hundreds of Facebook groups for crochet and knitting with tens of thousands of members. Not only do they share charts, basic knowledge, tips, etc., but the members also guide and support each other very enthusiastically.</b>
        From a young age, I've had a love of arts and crafts. From spending hours and hours drawing and colouring on the living room floor, creating beautiful cross stitch pictures and making never ending knitted scarves, I've always loved indulging in crafts.
